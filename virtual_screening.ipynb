    "The challenge in early stages of drug discovery is to narrow down a set of small molecules (molecules) from the large existing chemical space that are potentially binding to the target under investigation. Note that this chemical space is vast: Small molecules can be made of 10<sup>20</sup> combinations of chemical moieties ([<i>ACS Chem. Neurosci.</i> (2012), <b>19</b>, 649-57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019491)). \n",

This process is called virtual (high-throughput) screening: a large library of small molecules is filtered by rules and/or patterns, in order to identify those small molecules that are most likely to bind a target under investigation."

    "We have learned how to use fingerprints and similarity measures to compare a query molecule with a dataset of molecules and rank the molecule by similarity. This approach is an example for virtual screening of molecules.\n",
    "*Enrichment plots* (see TeachOpenCADD **T004**) and enrichment factors can be used to assess the performance. \n",

    "A drawback of a similarity search with molecular fingerprints is that it is based on molecular similarity and thus does not yield any novel structures. Another challenge when working with molecular similarity are so-called activity cliffs, i.e. a small change in a functional group of a molecule may initiate a jump in bioactivity. "
